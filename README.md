# Qt_ZoomBookmarks

Simple tool for managing all your online meetings and an easy way to attend them with just one click.

## Installation

1. All needed files and libraries are contained in the **'ZoomBookmarks_install_vX.X.zip'** file.<br>
The current version is **v1.1**<br>
2. Download and unpack the .zip file to a certain directory in your **User Folder** (due to writing access).<br>
3. Subsequently, you are ready to run the programm by double clicking the 'ZoomBookmarks.exe' file.<br>

## Updating

If you already have an installed version of ZoomBookmarks on your computer and you want to update to a newer
version without loosing your saved meetings, you can follow the following steps:

1. Download the zip file of the newer version.
2. Before you unzip and copy the new files to your programm folder, copy the **meetings.json** file and save it to somewhere else.
3. Now you can replace the program files with the files of the newer version.
4. Finally, replace the new (and empty) **meetings.json** file with the one you saved in step 2.
